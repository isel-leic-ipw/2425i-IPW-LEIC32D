## Evaluation

### Regular and Appeal Season
- Learning outcomes are assessed individually in the following components: test $[T]$ + practical work $[P]$.

- The final grade will be the best grade obtained through the following formula:

    - $40\\% [T] + 60\\% [E+P]$

- Details for each assessment component:

    - $[T]$ **1 Test** carried out during the normal exam period. 
        - The test may be repeated in the appeal season.
    - $[E]$ **Exercise Series** with individual delivery.
    - $[P]$ **Practical work** with 3 parts. 
        - The individual grade for each group element will be determined in an oral discussions, focused on the assignments carried out during the semester.

- **To pass the course, the student must meet all of the following conditions**:

    - The weighted average of all components must be greater than 9.5.
    - Each part of the work must be delivered till its deadline, and must have a grade greater than 9.5.
    - Test grade must be equal to or greater than 9.5.

### Special Season

- Assessment in the IPW special season exam has rules similar to the regular season.

- The theoretical component $[T]$ consists of a written test carried out on the date of the special examination period.

- The practical component $[P]$ is carried out individually. It has an autonomous statement and must be delivered before doing the written test, on the deadline date defined in the corresponding statement.
